The first time you run the character sheet you will need to run the setup file called `init.bat`.
This will create a python virtual enviornment and install all of the necessary modules
The necessary modules can be found in the requirements.txt file

```
.\init.bat
```

# Running the backend

To run the backend server just use the run.bat file

```
.\run.bat
```

# Running the front end

cd reactsheet
npm start
```
